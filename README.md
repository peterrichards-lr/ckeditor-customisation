# ckeditor-customisation

It is an example of how the CK Editor toolbar can be customised. This module simplely adds buttons for Superscript, Subscript, Indent and Outdent.

In order to retain the existing toolbar, it was necessary replicate the CK Editor Contributor within Liferay itself. As these classes as not exported in the OSGI bnd file, the classes themselves are not accessible.

This module has been tested on Liferay DXP 7.4 Update 50
